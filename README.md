# Unity DOTS Course

## Summary
This course contains three tutorials that introduce the basics of the **Entities** package, the **C# Job System**, and other core parts of **Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)**. DOTS facilitates writing high-performance C# code by enabling better optimization for modern multi-core processors and improving scalability for game and simulation development.

## Project Objective
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Write multi-threaded code** with the **C# Job System** to improve performance and responsiveness.
- **Create entities at runtime** using Unity's efficient data structures.
- **Load entities from scenes**, utilizing **baking** to optimize runtime performance.
- **Write systems** to **access and manipulate entities** for flexible, high-performance game logic.

## Key Concepts Covered:
- **Entities Package:** Learn how to structure and manage entities efficiently within Unity.
- **C# Job System:** Understand how to create multi-threaded jobs for improving performance across multiple cores.
- **Baking:** Use the baking system to prepare and optimize entities before runtime.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Unity and C#.
- Familiarity with concepts of performance optimization and multi-threading.
